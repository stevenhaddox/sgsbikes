(Hit us up if you would like to know what hotel we are looking at staying at) In Lake Havasu we are planning on doing some riding, relaxing, and partying it up SGSB style! March 10th we are departing Havasu and stopping again in Las Vegas to rest, fuel up, and get something to eat then heading back to Saint George. Don't miss out on this epic event! (Let us know if you plan on going so we can get a count and possibly a group rate at one of the hotels. Also if you do not own a bike, cars are more then welcome to come with us!)<br/><br/>

<b>First Ever Ride:</b><br/>
In October of 2012 Saint George Street Bikes had there first ever ride as a club! It was definitely a monumental moment for the club. The Ruff Ryders from the the Salt Lake City Chapter and Las Vegas Chapter showed up to vest our very own Dennis Bee as a member with them. After the vesting we took off from Saint George and drove up to Zion National Park. We stopped up there and took a couple minutes to enjoy the beauty then rode back home. Check out the gallery for the pictures of the ride!
