Hello, my name is Benjamin Haddox and this is my week 1 topics for the January semester of GD430 at WestWood College.</br></br></br>

Option 1: Tattoo Shop</br>
For this one I would make a site for a local tattoo shop. It would showcase information, galleries, and events. </br></br>
Option 2: Fishing Site </br>
This site would be designed to help people find information on fish, bait, techniques, and ect. As well as a personal gallery of my fishing experiences. </br></br>
Option 3: Snowboarding site</br>
This site would be designed to help people learn about the extreme sport snowboarding, and hopefully encourage them to go out and try the sport.</br>
It would contain useful information for getting started and videos and pictures.</br></br>
